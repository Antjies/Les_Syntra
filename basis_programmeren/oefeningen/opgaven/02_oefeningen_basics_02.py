# 1.
# Write a program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
# Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a while loop


# 2.
# Write a function named collatz() that has one parameter named number. 
# If number is even, then collatz() should print (number // 2 ) and return this value. 
# If number is odd, then collatz() should print and return  (3 * number + 1)


# 3.
# Then write a program that lets the user type in an integer and that keeps calling collatz() on that number until teh function returns the value 1.


# 4.
# Write a program to calculate the volume and surface area of a sphere from its radius, given as input.
# Here are some formulas that might be useful:
#  V = 4/3 * pi * (r**3)
#  A = 4 * pi * (r**2)


# 5.
# Write a program that calculates the cost per square inch (or centimeter) of a circular pizza, given its diameter and price.
# The formula for area is A = pi * r**2



# 6.
# Two points in a plane are specified using the coordinates(x1, y1)  and (x2, y2). 
# Write a program that calculates the slope of a line through two (non-vertical) points entered by the user.
# slope = (y2-y1)/(x2-x1)


# 7.
# Write a program that accepts two points (see previous problem) and determine the distance between them
# distance = root( (x2-x1)**2 + (y2-y1)**2 )


# 8.
# Write a program to find the sum of the first n natural numbers, where the value of n is provided by the user


# 9.
# Write a program to sum a series of numbers entered byt the user.
# The program should first prompt the user for how many numbers are to be summed.
# It should then input each of the numbers and print a total sum.
